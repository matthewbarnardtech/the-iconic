Establish core requirements.
    Console Application
    Read data from API
    Add video preview URL to object and write to out.json
    Ensure output is ordered by video preview presence
Looked at root URL without parameters for documentation
No documentation found
Went to search results route with search query string
Formatted output to view format
Structured code for CLI configuration
Added interfaces for data structure
Thought: Given another language I would have used a decorator but they are not available to TypeScript interfaces
Added consumer class to add video to data where relevant
Added readme
Moved network (API) calls to a service
